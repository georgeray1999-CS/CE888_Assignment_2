# CE888_Assignment_2

This is the repository for the final submission of the TweetEval Project.

HOW TO USE

The model_code directory contains the notebook explaining how the models were created, specific instructions are contained in the code itself as comments. The preprocessing_scripts directory contains the Python files and raw data that was used to prepare the data for the notebook. Please note that these files are similar to those submitted for the first assignment but some changes have been made to the preprocessing of the raw data and saving of the resulting files. A copy of the csv files that are produced by these Python scripts are held in the processed_data directory and the raw data held in this directory is downloaded automatically by the notebook when the task is specified.
